# yes-or-no-wheel
so i am a student currently working on my first ever website which is a simple yes or no tool which has the equal probability of a yes or no. Down below is the link to my website which uses a basic html css and JS code in order to enhance the wheels overall design and look. Futhermore, i am leaving a basic version of my entire html,css and js code in the code directory.
